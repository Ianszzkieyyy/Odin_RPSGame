# Odin_RPSGame

01/13/22 - Started this Javascript Rock Paper Scissor project. I am really surprised that I was able to get the basic functionality of the game in only an hour. The game is totally playable now, my only problem to tackle left is how to track the score of the user and the computer, and make it play and play until someone reaches 5 points, which I guess will have to do with loops. So I am going to tackle that problem sometime around later or tommorow. Anyways, still happy with the progress I made now :)

UPDATE 2: Continued progress for this one in the afternoon. And I've successfully managed to get the game loop working with while loops. It is completely playable now. I could do some more work refactoring some of that if else code but I think I'm pretty happy with what I did here and I feel confident moving on. Definitely one of the more challenging things I've done in javascript so far, this was the first time I did something like this all by myself without some template coming from youtube tutorials. Still got a long way to do, because I know real world problems are definitely harder than this.
